\title{Initialize and load the project environment}
\usage{
scaffold(config_file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{config_file}{Path to configuration file. If NULL (default), automatically
discovers settings.yml or config.yml in the project.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. The main effects are side effects:
loading packages, sourcing functions, and creating the \code{config} object.
}
\description{
The primary entry point for working with Framework projects. Call this at the
start of every notebook or script to set up your environment with all
configured packages, functions, and settings.
}
\details{
\code{scaffold()} performs the following steps in order:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Standardizes working directory} - Finds and sets the project root, even when called from notebooks in subdirectories
\item \strong{Loads environment variables} - Reads secrets from \code{.env} file
\item \strong{Loads configuration} - Parses settings.yml for project settings
\item \strong{Sets random seed} - For reproducibility (if \code{seed} is configured)
\item \strong{Installs packages} - Any missing packages from the \code{packages} list
\item \strong{Loads packages} - Attaches all configured packages
\item \strong{Sources functions} - Loads all \code{.R} files from \verb{functions/} directory
\item \strong{Creates config object} - Makes \code{config} available in global environment
}

After \code{scaffold()} completes, you have access to:
\itemize{
\item All packages listed in settings.yml
\item All functions from your \verb{functions/} directory
\item The \code{config} object for accessing settings via \code{config("key")}
\item Database connections configured in your project
}
}
\section{Project Discovery}{

When called without arguments, \code{scaffold()} searches for a Framework project by:
\itemize{
\item Looking for settings.yml or config.yml in current and parent directories
\item Checking for .Rproj or .code-workspace files with nearby settings
\item Recognizing common Framework subdirectories (notebooks/, scripts/, etc.)
}

This means you can call \code{scaffold()} from any subdirectory within your project.
}

\section{Configuration}{

The settings.yml file controls what \code{scaffold()} loads. Key settings include:
\itemize{
\item \code{packages}: List of R packages to install and load
\item \code{seed}: Random seed for reproducibility
\item \code{directories}: Custom directory paths
\item \code{connections}: Database connection configurations
}
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# At the top of every notebook or script:
library(framework)
scaffold()

# Now you can use your configured packages and functions
# Access settings via the config object:
config("directories.notebooks")
config("seed")
}

}
\seealso{
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=project_create]{project_create()}} to create a new Framework project
\item \code{\link[=standardize_wd]{standardize_wd()}} for just the working directory standardization
\item \code{\link[=config]{config()}} to access configuration values after scaffolding
}
}
