}
\arguments{
\item{type}{Character vector. Which stub types to publish:
\itemize{

\item "scripts" - R script stubs
\item "all" - All stubs (default)
}}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Whether to overwrite existing stubs. Default FALSE.}

\description{
Copies framework stub templates to your project's \verb{stubs/} directory, allowing
you to customize them. Similar to Laravel's \verb{artisan vendor:publish} command.
}
\details{
\subsection{Stub Customization Workflow}{
\enumerate{
\item Publish stubs to your project: \code{stubs_publish()}
\item Edit stubs in \verb{stubs/} directory to match your preferences
\item Use \code{make_notebook()} or \code{make_script()} - your custom stubs are used automatically
}
}

\subsection{Stub Naming Convention}{

Stubs follow this naming pattern:
\itemize{
\item Notebooks: \verb{stubs/notebook-\{name\}.qmd} or \verb{stubs/notebook-\{name\}.Rmd}
\item Scripts: \verb{stubs/script-\{name\}.R}
}

Framework searches user stubs first, then falls back to built-in stubs.
}

\subsection{Available Placeholders}{

Stubs can use these placeholders:
\itemize{
\item \code{{filename}} - File name without extension
\item \code{{date}} - Current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
}
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Publish all stubs
stubs_publish()

# Publish only notebook stubs
stubs_publish("notebooks")

# Publish specific stub
stubs_publish(stubs = "default")

# Overwrite existing stubs
stubs_publish(overwrite = TRUE)
}
