\description{
This function helps standardize the working directory when working with
framework projects, especially useful in Quarto/RMarkdown documents that
may be rendered from subdirectories.
}
\details{
The function looks for common framework project indicators:
\itemize{
\item settings.yml or settings.yml file
\item .Rprofile file
\item Being in common subdirectories (scratch, work)
}

It sets both the regular working directory and knitr's root.dir option
if knitr is available.
