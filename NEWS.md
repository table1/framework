# framework 1.1.0

* `plumber` moved from Imports to Suggests. plumber pulls in `sodium`, which
  needs the system libsodium library and often fails to install on HPC
  clusters. The GUI (`gui()`, `setup()`) now asks you to install plumber when
  you launch it; nothing else needs it
* New standard `logs` directory for run logs and cluster job output. All
  project gitignore templates now ignore `**/logs/**` and `slurm-*.out`, and
  `security_audit()` treats `logs` as a private directory
* `scaffold()` git checks are now portable across platforms
* Skills-based AI context: new projects get a thin canonical `AGENTS.md` plus
  Framework skills installed in `.claude/skills/` (workflow, data, packages,
  outputs, and sensitive-data rules as separate SKILL.md files)
* `AGENTS.md` replaces `CLAUDE.md` as the default canonical AI context file;
  CLAUDE.md and .github/copilot-instructions.md are now thin pointer stubs
* New `ai_skills_update()` refreshes a project's Framework skills after
  upgrading the package
* `ai_regenerate_context()` falls back to `CLAUDE.md` for projects created
  before 1.1.0
