After-DRY Follow-ups

- Test creation of `_quarto.yml` files on project creation.
- Add a `_quarto.yml` editor on View/Edit Project.
- Add dynamic sections to AI agent files (e.g., `[[::directory listing::]]`) that drop in directories and their purpose; this should replace the entire section starting with a `#` markdown heading.
- Add dynamic sections to `.gitignore` files that reflect project structure.
- Add “regenerate” functions for Quarto, GitHub, and `AGENTS.md`.
