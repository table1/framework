description: |
  Loads your project environment by reading settings, installing/loading packages,
  sourcing custom functions, and setting up your workspace. This is the first
  function you run after library(framework).

usage: scaffold(quiet = FALSE)

params:
  - name: quiet
    type: logical
    default: FALSE
    description: Suppress startup messages and package load notifications

returns: |
  Invisibly returns TRUE on success. Side effects include loading packages,
  sourcing functions from functions/ directory, and setting the random seed.

details: |
  scaffold() performs the following actions in order:

  1. Reads settings from settings.yml (or split settings files)
  2. Sets random seed if configured (for reproducibility)
  3. Installs missing packages from settings$packages
  4. Loads/attaches packages based on auto_attach configuration
  5. Sources all .R files in the functions/ directory
  6. Executes scaffold.R if present (for project-specific setup)

examples:
  - code: |
      library(framework)
      scaffold()
    description: Standard usage - loads environment with status messages

  - code: |
      library(framework)
      scaffold(quiet = TRUE)
    description: Silent mode - suppresses all startup messages

  - code: |
      # In your scaffold.R file (project-specific setup)
      message("Custom setup running...")
      options(scipen = 999)  # Disable scientific notation

  - The random seed is set from settings$seed or FW_SEED environment variable
  - All .R files in functions/ are sourced in alphabetical order
