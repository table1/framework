# Feature: Framework CLI Tool

## Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## Overview

Implemented a persistent CLI tool (`framework new`) that provides Laravel-style project creation, similar to `laravel new` or `npm init`. The CLI is a thin wrapper around `new-project.sh` from the framework-project repository, ensuring a single source of truth.

## Architecture

### Three Installation Paths

1. **CLI Tool** (Persistent, installed once)
   ```bash
  R -e "framework::cli_install()"
   framework new myproject
   ```

2. **One-Time Script** (No installation needed)
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://.../new-project.sh | bash
   ```

3. **Manual Clone** (Full control)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/table1/framework-project myproject
   ```

### Key Design Decision

**The CLI wrapper calls `new-project.sh` via curl**, rather than reimplementing the logic:

```bash
# inst/bin/framework (simplified)
case "$1" in
  new)
    shift
    curl -fsSL "$SCRIPT_URL/new-project.sh" | bash -s "$@"
    ;;
esac
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth (`new-project.sh`)
- ‚úÖ Always up-to-date (pulls latest from GitHub)
- ‚úÖ No code duplication
- ‚úÖ Consistent experience across all methods
- ‚úÖ Easy maintenance (fix once in `new-project.sh`)

## Technical Details

### CLI Script (inst/bin/framework)

Thin bash wrapper with three commands:
- `framework new [name] [type]` - Calls new-project.sh via curl
- `framework version` - Shows package version
- `framework help` - Shows usage information

### Installation Function (R/install_cli.R)

Two functions:
- `cli_install(location)` - Installs shim/global scripts (symlink when available, copies otherwise)
  - `location = "user"` ‚Üí `~/.local/bin/framework` (default, no sudo)
  - `location = "system"` ‚Üí `/usr/local/bin/framework` (requires sudo)
- `uncli_install(location)` - Removes symlink

### Package Attach Hook (R/zzz.R)

`.onAttach()` checks if CLI is installed and prompts user if not:
```
Framework loaded! üéâ

Tip: Install the CLI for quick project creation:
  framework::cli_install()

Then use: framework new myproject
```

## Usage Examples

### Installation

```r
# Install Framework package
devtools::install_github("table1/framework")

# Install CLI (one-time)
framework::cli_install()
```

### Creating Projects

```bash
# Interactive mode
framework new

# Quick creation
framework new myproject

# Specify type
framework new slides presentation
framework new coursework course
```

### Other Commands

```bash
framework version  # Show version
framework help     # Show help
```

## Platform Support

- ‚úÖ Linux
- ‚úÖ macOS
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows (WSL only)

Requires bash shell. Native Windows not supported (use WSL).

## Testing Strategy

Manual testing performed:
- ‚úÖ CLI help output renders correctly
- ‚úÖ `.onAttach()` message displays on package load
- ‚úÖ Documentation generates correctly
- ‚úÖ Functions export properly to NAMESPACE

**Note:** Actual project creation testing requires pushing `new-project.sh` to GitHub first (CI/CD will validate).

## Breaking Changes

None. This is a new feature that doesn't affect existing functionality.

## Migration Steps

None required. Existing workflows continue to work:
- `framework::init()` unchanged
- Template clone unchanged
- The curl script renamed but kept backwards compatible

## Documentation Updates

- [x] Function documentation (roxygen2) - `install_cli.Rd`, `uninstall_cli.Rd`
- [x] CLAUDE.md updates - Not needed (no workflow/standards change)
- [x] README updates - Both repos updated with CLI instructions
- [x] CLI guide created - `docs/cli.md`

## Zen Consensus Results

**Consulted:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (FOR bash-based approach)

**Verdict:** 9/10 confidence in bash-based CLI
- Prioritizes developer experience (speed, responsiveness)
- Follows industry standard pattern (npm, pip, composer)
- Minimal maintenance burden (thin wrapper)
- Platform trade-off acceptable (95% of target audience)

**Key Takeaway:** "The bash wrapper's speed and familiar ergonomics are critical for user adoption and satisfaction among developers."

## Notes

### Why new-project.sh Instead of bootstrap.sh?

Original suggestion was `bootstrap.sh`, but user preferred `new-project.sh`:
- More descriptive ("new project" is clearer than "bootstrap")
- Mirrors CLI command structure (`framework new`)
- Immediately obvious what the script does

### Why CLI Calls new-project.sh?

Alternative was to reimplement logic in bash CLI. Rejected because:
- Code duplication
- Two implementations to maintain
- Risk of drift between CLI and curl methods
- Complexity without benefit

Instead, CLI is a thin wrapper that fetches and executes `new-project.sh`. This ensures:
- Single source of truth
- Always up-to-date
- Consistent behavior
- Simple maintenance

### Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

**Local Caching:** CLI could cache `new-project.sh` locally (~/.cache/framework/) and refresh periodically (e.g., weekly). This would:
- Improve speed (no network fetch)
- Enable offline usage
- Add complexity (cache invalidation, staleness checks)

**Decision:** Start simple (fetch fresh each time). Add caching later if needed.

## Deployment Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub:

- [x] All files committed in framework package
- [x] All files committed in framework-project
- [x] Documentation builds without errors
- [x] NAMESPACE exports new functions
- [ ] Push framework package to GitHub
- [ ] Push framework-project to GitHub
- [ ] Test CLI with live GitHub URLs
- [ ] Update any external documentation (if applicable)

## Success Metrics

How we'll know this feature is successful:
- Users adopt CLI workflow (measure via GitHub discussions/issues)
- Fewer questions about "how to start a new project"
- Positive feedback on developer experience
- Reduced friction for creating multiple projects

## Related Issues/PRs

- N/A (initial implementation)

## Next Steps

1. **Push changes to GitHub** (both repos)
2. **Test live CLI** with real GitHub URLs
3. **Monitor feedback** from users
4. **Consider caching** if network fetch becomes a bottleneck
5. **Windows native support?** If demand exists, could implement PowerShell version
