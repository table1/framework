# Feature: Example Feature Template

## Overview
This is an example feature proposal file that demonstrates the structure and workflow for feature development in the Framework package. Use this as a reference when creating new feature proposals.

## Requirements
- [x] Define clear requirements for the feature
- [x] List all necessary functionality
- [x] Identify edge cases and constraints

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] Design and planning
- [x] Core implementation
- [x] Tests written
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Code review completed
- [x] All tests passing

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify
- `R/example.R` - Add new `example_function()` with full validation
- `tests/testthat/test-example.R` - Add comprehensive test suite

### New Dependencies
- None (or list specific packages with reasons)

### Breaking Changes
- None (or describe migration path for users)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test basic functionality with valid inputs
- Test all edge cases (NULL, NA, empty, zero-length)
- Test error conditions (invalid types, out of bounds)
- Test database operations with mocked connections

### Integration Tests
- Test interaction with config system
- Test interaction with cache system
- Test file I/O operations

## Documentation Updates
- [x] Function documentation (roxygen2)
- [x] CLAUDE.md updates (added feature workflow section)
- [x] README updates (if user-facing changes)

## Notes

### Design Decisions
- Chose to use checkmate for validation (consistent with codebase standards)
- Wrapped all external operations in try/catch (defensive programming)
- Used on.exit() for resource cleanup (best practice)

### Challenges Encountered
- None (or describe specific challenges and how they were resolved)

### Future Enhancements
- Potential improvements or related features to consider later
