# Feature Proposals and Development Tracking

This directory contains feature proposals and tracks their development progress.

## Quick Start

1. **Create a new feature proposal** using the template in `example_feature.md`
2. **Name it descriptively**: `feature_name.md` (e.g., `data_versioning.md`, `async_queries.md`)
3. **Fill out all sections** before starting development
4. **Check off items** as you complete them during development
5. **Mark complete** by renaming to `feature_name_COMPLETED.md` when done

## File States

- **Active**: `feature_name.md` - Currently in development
- **Completed**: `feature_name_COMPLETED.md` - Fully implemented and merged
- **Example**: `example_feature.md` - Reference template (do not modify)

## Template Sections

Every feature proposal should include:

- **Overview** - What and why
- **Requirements** - Functional requirements as a checklist
- **Implementation Checklist** - Development stages
- **Technical Details** - Files, dependencies, breaking changes
- **Testing Strategy** - How you'll verify it works
- **Documentation Updates** - What docs need updating
- **Notes** - Decisions, challenges, future enhancements

## Benefits
